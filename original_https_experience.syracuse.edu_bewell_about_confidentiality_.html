        <h2><strong>Counseling Services</strong></h2>
<p>Counseling services are completely confidential, except in cases where there is a court order requiring the release of information or there is imminent danger to self or others. For you, this means we do not release information to your parents, faculty, staff or others about your counseling without a signed release from you that would permit such an exchange of information.</p>
<h3><strong>Counseling Policy</strong></h3>
<p>Counseling services adheres to the ethical guidelines of the American Psychological Association, including strictly respecting your right to confidentiality of records and information shared by you in a counseling session. All records, computerized and written, will be stored, retrieved and maintained according to acceptable ethical guidelines. Counseling services will generally release records only to other mental health care providers; however, you should be aware that there are certain circumstances under which your right to confidentiality may be outweighed by a conflicting legal or ethical duty of the Counseling services to disclose confidential information. For example, if the Counseling services determines that you are potentially harmful to yourself or others, or learns of child neglect or abuse, or is ordered by a court of law or otherwise required by law to surrender its records (as in child custody cases), then the Counseling services may have to disclose information that you shared on a confidential basis. In all other circumstances, the Counseling services will obtain your prior written permission before disclosing your confidential information to anyone.</p>
<h3><strong>Academic Records</strong></h3>
<p>Counseling services records are separate from a student’s academic record. No one in the University has access to a student’s Counseling services record unless the student gives permission for that access.</p>
<h3><strong>Taped Sessions</strong></h3>
<p>As a training site for counseling programs at Syracuse University, permission may be requested of clients to videotape sessions for the purpose of enhancing counselor development. These recordings will be used to aid the counseling process and gain further understanding of important aspects of treatment. You will never be video recorded without your consent, and you have the right to decline being taped without any impact on your ability to receive counseling services.</p>
<h3><strong>Electronic Mail</strong></h3>
<p>Due to concerns regarding confidentiality, the Counseling services does not use email to communicate with clients.</p>
<h3><strong>Excuse Notes</strong></h3>
<p>As a general policy, Counseling services will not write notes to excuse you from your academic responsibilities. In specific circumstances, mutually agreed upon by you and your therapist, the Counseling services can verify only that you were a client at the center and the dates that you attended sessions. Missed classes or incomplete work are issues between you and your instructor.</p>

For each category, we have provided a description and some examples of the permitted uses and/or disclosures. The following examples are illustrative and are not meant to be a complete description of the permitted uses and disclosures of Health Care.</p>
<ol>

For example, we may use or disclose treatment records to your health insurer or to another party responsible for payment in order to obtain payment, or to certify that you are eligible for benefits. We may also disclose to your insurer information about a treatment or service you may receive from Health Care in order to obtain prior approval for such service, or to determine whether your plan will cover the treatment or service.</li>
<li><strong>Health Care Operations.</strong><span> </span>Health Care may use and/or disclose treatment records in order to conduct its normal business operations. For example, Health  Care  may use your treatment records to review the treatment and services it provided, to evaluate the performance of its staff in caring for you or to educate its staff on how to improve the care they provide to you. Health Care may also disclose your treatment records to another entity that performs business services on behalf of Health Care, such as billing companies, technology and software vendors, attorneys or external auditors. Prior to such disclosures, however, FERPA requires Health Care to sign a Business Associate Agreement with such entities to ensure the protection of your treatment records.</li>

We may also call to follow up on care you received, to communicate test results, or to confirm an appointment with Health Care or another health care provider.</li>
<li><strong>Individuals Involved in Your Care or Payment for Your Care.</strong><span> </span>Subject to the Family Educational Rights in Privacy Act (FERPA), FERPA permits Health Care to disclose your treatment records to a family member, other relative or any other person identified by you, if:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>you are present for, or otherwise available prior to the disclosure and we have either obtained your agreement to the disclosure, provided you the opportunity to object to the disclosure, or Health Care has reasonably inferred from the circumstances that you do not object to the disclosures;</li>
<li>due to your incapacity or an emergency circumstance, Health Care has determined that a disclosure is in your best interest – in such circumstances, Health Care will only disclose treatment records that are directly relevant to the person’s involvement with your health care.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Emergencies.</strong><span> </span>Health Care may use and/or disclose treatment records to provide you with emergency treatment in emergency situations.</li>
<li><strong>As Required by Law.</strong><span> </span>Health Care may use and/or disclose your treatment records if we are required to do so under any federal, state or local law.</li>

<li>to your employer, if your employer hires us to provide you with a medical evaluation or to evaluate whether you have a work-related illness or injury that your employer must know about in order to comply with employment laws.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>Victims of Abuse, Neglect or Domestic Violence.</strong><span> </span>Health Care may disclose your treatment records to government authorities, including a social service or protective services agency, authorized by law to receive reports of abuse, neglect or domestic violence. For example, Health Care may report your treatment records to government officials if it reasonably believes that you have been a victim of abuse, neglect or domestic violence. Health Care will make every effort to obtain your permission before releasing this information, however, in some cases Health Care may be required or authorized to act without your permission.</li>
<li><strong>Health Oversight Activities.</strong><span> </span>Health Care may disclose your treatment records to a health oversight agency for activities authorized by law. These agencies typically monitor the operation of the health care system, government benefits programs and compliance with government regulatory programs.

A qualified protective order is an order of a court or an administrative tribunal or a stipulation by parties to the litigation that prohibits the parties from using or disclosing treatment records for any purpose other than the litigation or proceeding. A qualified protective order will require the return of treatment records to Health Care at the end of the litigation or proceeding.</li>
<li><strong>Law Enforcement Purposes.</strong><span> </span>Health Care may disclose your treatment records to law enforcement officials for the following reasons:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>in response to court orders, warrants, subpoenas, or summons or similar legal process;</li>
<li>to assist law enforcement officials with identifying or locating a suspect, fugitive, material witness or missing person;</li>
<li>if you have been or are suspected of being a victim of a crime and you agree to the disclosure, or if we are unable to obtain your agreement because of incapacity or other emergency;</li>
<li>if we suspect that a death resulted from criminal conduct;</li>
<li>to report evidence of criminal conduct that occurred on our premises;</li>
<li>in response to a medical emergency, to report a crime (including the location or victims of the crime; or the identity, description or location of the person who committed the crime).</li>

Health Care may also release treatment records to funeral directors as necessary to carry out their duties.</li>
<li><strong>Research.</strong><span> </span>In most cases, Health Care will ask for your written authorization before using and/or disclosing your treatment records to conduct research. However, in limited circumstances we may use and/or disclose treatment records without authorization if: (i) the use or disclosure was approved by an Institutional Review Board or a Privacy Board; and (ii) we obtain representations from the researcher that the information is necessary for the research protocol, treatment records will not be removed from our practice and the information will be used solely for research purposes; or (iii) the treatment records sought by the researcher relates only to decedents and the researcher agrees that the use or disclosure is necessary for the research.</li>
<li><strong>To Avert Serious Threat to Health or Safety.</strong><span> </span>Health Care may use or disclose your treatment records when necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to your health or safety, or the health or safety of another person or the public.

You may revoke any authorization at any time, provided that your revocation is done in writing, and except to the extent that Health Care has already relied upon your authorization.</p>
<h4><strong>C. Your Rights Regarding Your Treatment Records</strong></h4>
<p>FERPA provides you with the following rights regarding the treatment records we maintain about you:</p>

If Health Care needs additional time to respond to your request for copies, we will notify you in writing within the time frame above to explain the reason(s) for such delay and when you can expect to have a final answer to your request. Under certain circumstances, Health Care may deny your request to inspect or obtain a copy of your treatment records. If your request for inspection is denied, we will provide you with a written notice explaining our reasons for such denial, and will include a complete description of your rights to have the decision reviewed and how you can exercise those rights.</p>
<ol start="2">

</ol>
<p>Health Care may deny your request for amendment if it determines that the treatment records or record that is the subject of the request:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>was not created by Health Care, unless you provide a reasonable basis to believe that the originator of the treatment</strong></li>
<li>is not part of the designated record set;</li>
<li>would not be available for your inspection under the Privacy Standards (as described in Right to Inspect and Copy Section, above); or</li>
<li>is accurate and complete.</li>
</ul>

These procedures will be explained in greater detail in any written denial notice.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Right to an Accounting of Disclosures.</strong><span> </span>You have a right to request an “accounting of disclosures” which identifies certain disclosures of your health information made within the six years prior to your request.

</ol>
<p>Health Care will not ask you the reason for your request, and will accommodate all reasonable requests. Your request must specify how or where you wish to be contacted, and how payment for health care will be handled if Health Care communicates with you through this alternative method or location. To request confidential communications, you must make your request in writing to: Syracuse University Barnes Center at The Arch, 150 Sims Drive, Syracuse, N.Y. 13244.</p>

<h3 id="s:b-how-health-care-services-may">B. How Health Care Services May Use and Disclose Your Treatment Records</h3>
<p>FERPA permits Health Care Services, its Business Associates, and their agents/subcontractors, if any, to use and/or disclose your treatment records, without prior authorization, for the purposes of treatment, payment and other health care services operations of Health Care Services, which are described below. Health Care Services will disclose your treatment records to its Business Associates only if it has received satisfactory assurances that its Business Associates will appropriately safeguard your treatment records. FERPA also permits Health Care Services to use and disclose your treatment records, without prior authorization, for other specific purposes that are also described below. For each category, we have provided a description and some examples of the permitted uses and/or disclosures. The following examples are illustrative and are not meant to be a complete description of the permitted uses and disclosures of Health Care Services.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Treatment</strong>. Health Care Services may use and/or disclose your treatment records with other health care providers who are involved in your care and treatment. For example, Health Care Services may use or disclose treatment records about you to physicians, nurses, paraprofessionals, technicians or other Health Care Services personnel who are involved in your care and treatment. Many of the people that work for Health Care Services, including, but not limited to, our health care providers, may use or disclose your treatment records in order to treat you or to assist others in your care and treatment. We may also disclose treatment records about you to health care providers outside of our office who are involved in your care or treatment. For example, we may disclose your treatment records to a referring physician or a pharmacy for treatment purposes. We may also share your treatment records in order to coordinate services, such as laboratory work and/or X-rays.</li>
<li><strong>Payment.<span> </span></strong>Health Care Services may use and/or disclose your treatment records in order to bill or to collect payment for services you have received from Health Care Services. For example, we may use or disclose treatment records to your health insurer or to another party responsible for payment in order to obtain payment, or to certify that you are eligible for benefits. We may also disclose to your insurer information about a treatment or service you may receive from Health Care Services in order to obtain prior approval for such service, or to determine whether your plan will cover the treatment or service.</li>
<li><strong>Health Care Operations.</strong><span> </span>Health Care Services may use and/or disclose treatment records in order to conduct its normal business operations. For example, Health Care Services may use your treatment records to review the treatment and services it provided, to evaluate the performance of its staff in caring for you or to educate its staff on how to improve the care they provide to you. Health Care Services may also disclose your treatment records to another entity that performs business services on behalf of Health Care Services, such as billing companies, technology and software vendors, attorneys or external auditors. Prior to such disclosures, however, FERPA requires Health Care Services to sign a Business Associate Agreement with such entities to ensure the protection of your treatment records.</li>
<li><strong>Appointment Reminders/Follow-Up Telephone Calls/Emails.</strong><span> </span>Health Care Services may use and/or disclose treatment records to contact you with a reminder that you have an appointment for treatment or medical care. Such contacts may include telephone messages and/or electronic mail messages. We may also call to follow up on care you received, to communicate test results or to confirm an appointment with Health Care Services or another health care provider.</li>
<li><strong>Individuals Involved in Your Care or Payment for Your Care.</strong><span> </span>Subject to the Family Educational Rights in Privacy Act (FERPA), FERPA permits Health Care Services to disclose your treatment records to a family member, other relative or any other person identified by you, if:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>you are present for, or otherwise available prior to the disclosure, and we have either obtained your agreement to the disclosure, provided you the opportunity to object to the disclosure, or Health Care Services has reasonably inferred from the circumstances that you do not object to the disclosures;</li>
<li>due to your incapacity or an emergency circumstance, Health Care Services has determined that a disclosure is in your best interest – in such circumstances, Health Care Services will only disclose treatment records that are directly relevant to the person’s involvement with your health care services.</li>
</ul>
<p>6.<strong><span> </span>Emergencies.</strong><span> </span>Health Care Services may use and/or disclose treatment records to provide you with emergency treatment in emergency situations.</p>
<p>7.<strong><span> </span>As Required by Law.</strong><span> </span>Health Care Services may use and/or disclose your treatment records if we are required to do so under any federal, state or local law.</p>
<p>8.<strong><span> </span>Public Health Risks.</strong><span> </span>Health Care Services may use and/or disclose your treatment records to authorized public health officials (or a foreign government agency collaborating with such officials) so such officials may carry out public health activities.

<li>to your employer, if your employer hires us to provide you with a medical evaluation or to evaluate whether you have a work-related illness or injury that your employer must know about in order to comply with employment laws.</li>
</ul>
<p>9.<strong><span> </span>Victims of Abuse, Neglect or Domestic Violence.</strong><span> </span>Health Care Services may disclose your treatment records to government authorities, including a social service or protective services agency, authorized by law to receive reports of abuse, neglect or domestic violence. For example, Health Care Services may report your treatment records to government officials if it reasonably believes that you have been a victim of abuse, neglect or domestic violence. Health Care Services will make every effort to obtain your permission before releasing this information, however, in some cases Health Care Services may be required or authorized to act without your permission.</p>
<p>10.<strong><span> </span>Health Oversight Activities.</strong><span> </span>Health Care Services may disclose your treatment records to a health oversight agency for activities authorized by law. These agencies typically monitor the operation of the health care system, government benefits programs and compliance with government regulatory programs. The oversight activities may include audits; civil, criminal or administrative investigations or actions; inspections; and/or licensure or disciplinary actions.</p>
<p>11.<strong><span> </span>Lawsuits and Similar Proceedings.</strong><span> </span>Health Care Services may use or disclose your treatment records in response to a court or administrative order, if you are involved in a lawsuit or similar proceeding.

A qualified protective order is an order of a court or an administrative tribunal, or a stipulation by parties to the litigation that prohibits the parties from using or disclosing treatment records for any purpose other than the litigation or proceeding. A qualified protective order will require the return of treatment records to Health Care Services at the end of the litigation or proceeding.</p>
<p>12.<span> </span><strong>Law Enforcement Purposes.</strong><span> </span>Health Care Services may disclose your treatment records to law enforcement officials for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>in response to court orders, warrants, subpoenas or summons, or similar legal process;</li>
<li>to assist law enforcement officials with identifying or locating a suspect, fugitive, material witness or missing person;</li>
<li>if you have been or are suspected of being a victim of a crime and you agree to the disclosure, or if we are unable to obtain your agreement because of incapacity or other emergency.</li>

<li>to report evidence of criminal conduct that occurred on our premises;</li>

<p>14.<strong><span> </span>Research.</strong><span> </span>In most cases, Health Care Services will ask for your written authorization before using and/or disclosing your treatment records to conduct research.

<p>15.<strong><span> </span>To Avert Serious Threat to Health or Safety.</strong><span> </span>Health Care Services may use or disclose your treatment records when necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to your health or safety, or the health or safety of another person or the public. In such cases, Health Care Services will only share your treatment records with a person or persons reasonably able to prevent or lessen the threat, including the target of the threat; or if it is necessary for law enforcement authorities to identify or apprehend an individual.</p>

<p>Barnes Center at The Arch Health Care does not issue excuse notes or medical excuses requested by patients/students. Doing so creates an undesirable climate for health care professionals and disempowers students. Responsibility for class attendance and completion of assignments rests primarily with the students, who assumes responsibility by communicating directly with faculty.</p>
<p>In cases where students are absent from class for an extended period of time (48 hours or more), Health Care will work with the University to send absence notifications to faculty. If an illness lasts less than 48 hours, the student should discuss academic arrangements directly with their faculty.</p>
<p>In general, the following conditions will not warrant an absence notification regardless of duration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verification of illness after the illness is over.</li>

        <p>A student wishing to take a medical leave of absence must first discuss this request with<span> </span><a href="https://experience.syracuse.edu/student-outreach/">Student Outreach and Support</a>. To contact, please<span> </span><a href="mailto:studentsupport@syr.edu">email Student Outreach and Support</a>  or call<span> </span><a href="tel:3154434357">315.443.4357</a><span> </span>(HELP).</p>
<p>Student Outreach and Support will notify Barnes Center at The Arch Health Care of the student’s request to take a medical leave of absence. Additionally, a form that will include the information below from Health Care will be emailed to the student’s @syr.edu email account.</p>
<h2>Request for Medical Leave of Absence</h2>
<p>In order to take a medical leave of absence from Syracuse University, the completed<span> </span><a href="https://experience.syracuse.edu/bewell/primary-health-care/#health-care-billing">Request for Medical Leave of Absence<span> </span>Form</a>, along with documentation* from your licensed health care provider, must be submitted to Health Care and approved by the Medical Director or appropriate designee.</p>
<p>The completed form from your licensed health care provider must be received within thirty (30) days of the date of your departure and should include the following information.</p>
<ul>
<li>A medical diagnosis.</li>
<li>Confirmation of diagnosis and its severity must be provided. Confirmation may include relevant progress notes, diagnostic tests and/or treatment.</li>
<li>Describe the impact on academic performance if the medical leave is not granted.</li>
<li>In the provider’s medical opinion, is a medical leave of absence required, and if so, explained in detail.</li>
<li>Is the condition permanent or cyclical.</li>
<li>The anticipated recovery time for the diagnosis.</li>
<li>The date of last scheduled visit.</li>
<li>The length of time that the provider has been treating the medical condition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once Health Care has received the completed form, the student will be notified in writing as to whether the medical leave of absence has been approved, denied or if additional documentation is needed. <strong>Important note: The date that a student makes the request to the University for medical leave of absence will be the effective date of the medical leave of absence. Any request for medical leave of absence made after the withdraw deadline will result in the student receiving failing grades (e.g. letter grade of F) unless there are extenuating circumstances as reviewed and deemed as such by appropriate health and wellness designee.</strong></p>
<h2>Readmission to the University</h2>
<p>Should the student wish to return to Syracuse University after taking a medical leave of absence, Health Care will need additional documentation* from the student’s licensed health care provider. Return to Syracuse University must also be approved by the Medical Director or appropriate designee.</p>
<p>The documentation from the student’s licensed health care provider should be a summary letter which includes the following information.</p>
<ul>
<li>A statement that the student is cleared to return to Syracuse University without any restrictions.</li>
<li>Provided date that the student is able to return to classes.</li>
<li>The summary letter must be on office letterhead and must be signed by the student’s licensed health care provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once Health Care has received the documentation and the return from a medical leave of absence has been approved, the student will be contacted by Student Outreach and Support.</p>
<p><strong>International Students:</strong> Are asked to please begin the return from medical leave of absence process as soon as the student’s medical provider feels appropriate, in advance of the deadlines below to ensure sufficient time for a new I-20 to be processed. Please contact the <a href="http://international.syr.edu/">Center for International Services</a><span> </span>to discuss any questions/concerns regarding international student status and I-20.</p>
<h2>Readmission Deadlines</h2>
<p>Please take note of the deadlines below. Failure to meet a deadline may result in return to Syracuse University being postponed until the following semester. Additionally, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their home school/college for specific academic requirements regarding re-enrollment.</p>

<li>Readmission for the Spring: Supporting documents to Health Care by Dec. 15.</li>

        <p>You have the right to receive a “Good Faith Estimate” explaining how much your health care will cost. Under the law, health care providers need to give<span> </span><strong>patients who don’t have certain types of health care coverage or who are not using certain types of health care coverage<span> </span></strong>an estimate of their bill for health care items and services before those items or services are provided.</p>
<ul>
<li>You have the right to receive a Good Faith Estimate for the total expected cost of any health care items or services upon request or when scheduling such items or services. This includes related costs like medical tests, prescription drugs, equipment and hospital fees.</li>
<li>If you schedule a health care item or service at least three business days in advance, make sure your health care provider or facility gives you a Good Faith Estimate in writing within one business day after scheduling.</li>
<li>If you schedule a health care item or service at least 10 business days in advance, make sure your health care provider or facility gives you a Good Faith Estimate in writing within three business days after scheduling.</li>
<li>You can also ask any health care provider or facility for a Good Faith Estimate before you schedule an item or service. If you do, make sure the health care provider or facility gives you a Good Faith Estimate in writing within three business days after you ask.</li>
<li>If you receive a bill that is at least $400 more for any provider or facility than your Good Faith Estimate from that provider or facility, you can dispute the bill.</li>
<li>Make sure to save a copy or picture of your Good Faith Estimate and the bill.</li>

        <h2 id="s:applying-for-an-exchange-visitor-visa">Applying for an Exchange Visitor Visa</h2>
<p>Visa applicants should apply at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate, generally in their country of permanent residence. As part of the visa application process, an interview at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate is required for visa applicants from ages 14-79, with few exceptions. Persons ages 13 and younger and ages 80 and older generally do not require an interview unless requested by the embassy or consulate. The waiting time for an interview appointment for applicants can vary, so early visa application is strongly encouraged. Visa wait times for interview appointments and visa processing time information for each U.S. Embassy or Consulate worldwide is available on the Department of State (DOS) website at<span> </span><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/wait-times.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visa Wait Times</a>, and on most embassy websites. If you are authorized by your sponsor to be accompanied by your spouse (husband or wife) and children, the sponsor will give a Form DS-2019 to both the applicant and their family. The family may apply for their visas at the same time.<span> </span>Learn how to schedule an appointment for an interview, pay the application processing fee, review embassy-specific instructions and much more by visiting the <a href="http://www.usembassy.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Embassy or Consulate website</a> where you will apply.</p>
<p>During the visa application process, usually at the interview, an ink-free, digital fingerprint scan will be quickly taken. Some visa applications require further <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/administrative-processing-information.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">administrative processing</a>, which takes additional time after the visa applicant&#8217;s interview by a consular officer.</p>
<h3 id="s:required-documentation">Required Documentation</h3>
<p>When applying, each visa applicant must submit to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate these forms and documentation, as explained below:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>DS-2019, Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor Status</strong>.<span> </span>A SEVIS-generated form, DS-2019, is provided to you by your program sponsor after the sponsor enters your information in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). All exchange visitors, including their spouses and dependents, must be registered in SEVIS.</li>
<li><strong>Those in J-1 Student Intern category must submit a Training/Internship Placement Plan, Form DS-7002</strong>. All J-1 Student Interns (based on Box 7 on form) must also present a Training/Internship Placement Plan, Form<span> </span><a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/84240.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DS-7002</a>, when applying for a visa. For more information about the rules for trainee and intern programs, see the Exchange Visitor Program<span> </span><a href="http://exchanges.state.gov/jexchanges/programs/trainee.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trainee webpage</a> on the ECA website.</li>
<li><strong>Form DS-160, Online Nonimmigrant Visa Electronic Application</strong>.

<li><strong>A passport valid for travel to the U.S.</strong><span> </span>The passport must have a validity date at least six months beyond the applicant&#8217;s intended period of stay in the U.S. (unless<span> </span><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/intl-treaties.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">country-specific agreements</a><span> </span>provide exemptions). If more than one person is included in the passport, each person desiring a visa must complete an application.</li>
<li><strong>Proof of SEVIS fee payment</strong>. For detailed information on the SEVIS fee payment process and for a list of frequently asked questions, visit the<span> </span><a href="https://www.ice.gov/sevis/i901">U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement website</a>.</li>
<li><strong>One (1) 2&#215;2 inch photograph</strong>. See the required photo format explained in <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/photos.html#nonimmigrant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nonimmigrant Photograph Requirements</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s:what-are-the-required-visa-fees">What Are the Required Visa Fees?</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>Nonimmigrant visa application processing fee:</strong> For current fees for DOS government services, select <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/exchange.html#fees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fees</a>. You will need to provide a receipt showing the visa application processing fee has been paid when you come for your visa interview.</li>
<li><strong>Visa issuance fee</strong>: Additionally, if the visa is issued, if applicable, there will be an additional visa issuance reciprocity fee. Please review the<span> </span><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/Visa-Reciprocity-and-Civil-Documents-by-Country.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visa Reciprocity Tables</a><span> </span>to find out if you must pay a visa issuance reciprocity fee and what the fee amount is.
<ul type="disc">
<li>NOTE:<span> </span>U.S. government-sponsored exchange visitor (J visa) applicants and their dependents are not required to pay any applicable reciprocity fees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s:additional-documentation">Additional Documentation</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Find out if there are any additional documentation items required by reviewing the <a href="http://www.usembassy.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Embassy or Consulate website</a> where you will apply for your visa.</li>
<li>Applicants must demonstrate to the consular officer that they have binding ties to a residence in a foreign country which they have no intention of abandoning, and that they are coming to the U.S. for a temporary period. It is impossible to specify the exact form the evidence should take since applicants&#8217; circumstances vary greatly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s:my-visa-has-been-issued-when">My Visa Has Been Issued. When Can I Travel to the U.S.?</h3>
<p>U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulation requires that all beginning (initial) J exchange visitors, and J-2 spouse and dependents, enter the U.S. 30 days or less in advance of the applicant&#8217;s program start date as shown on the Form DS-2019. The 30-day limitation does not apply to current exchange participants who are returning to continue with their exchange program.</p>
<p>If you want an earlier entry in the U.S. (more than 30 days prior to the course start date), you must qualify for and obtain a visitor visa; however, this is strongly discouraged.</p>
<h3 id="s:spouses-and-children">Spouses and Children</h3>
<p>Spouses and/or children under the age of 21 who wish to accompany or join the principal (or primary) exchange visitor (J) visa holder in the U.S. for the duration of their stay require exchange visitor visas. The application procedure is the same as that for a primary visa applicant. The sponsor must approve the accompaniment of the spouse and/or children and who will each be issued their own Form DS-2019. This form is used to obtain the required visa, and the spouse and dependents can enter the U.S. at the same time as the principal exchange visitor or at a later date.</p>
<h4>Work</h4>
<p>The spouse and/or children of an exchange visitor in the U.S. may not work in J-2 status unless they have filed Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has approved permission to work. To learn more, visit the<span> </span><a href="https://experience.syracuse.edu/intercultural-collective/center-for-international-services/employment/j-2-dependent-employment-authorization/">J-2 Dependent Employment Authorization webpage</a>.</p>
<h4>Study</h4>
<p>The spouse and/or children of an exchange visitor visa holder who are in the U.S. on an exchange visitor visa may study in the U.S. without also being required to apply for a student (F-1) visa or change to F-1 status.</p>
<p>Spouses and/or children who do not intend to reside in the U.S. with the principal visa holder, but<span> </span>visit for<span> </span><strong>vacations only</strong>, may be eligible to apply for <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visitor (B-2) visas</a><span> </span>or, if qualified, travel without a visa under the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visa Waiver Program</a>.</p>
<h4>Family Members Following to Join the Exchange Visitor</h4>
<p>The spouse and children can also apply for visas after the principal applicant has already traveled. In general, they must present the following:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Form DS-2019, SEVIS-generated and approved by the sponsor.</li>
<li>Proof that the principal applicant (the person who received the DS-2019) is maintaining their J-visa status.</li>
<li>Copy of the J-1&#8217;s (principal applicant&#8217;s) visa.</li>
<li>Proof of relationship to the principal applicant.</li>
<li>Proof of sufficient money to cover all expenses in the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE: Spouses and children of exchange visitors may not enter the U.S. before the primary exchange visitor enters for the first time.</strong></p>
<h3 id="s:the-sevis-fee">The SEVIS Fee</h3>
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s Federal SEVIS Fee took effect on Sept. 1, 2004. The fee of $180.00 is generally a one-time fee (see exceptions below), and is required of those who are applying for a J-1 visa based on a DS-2019 issued to &#8220;begin a new program.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Proof of fee payment must be presented at the visa interview.</strong></p>
<p>You<span> </span><strong>must pay</strong><span> </span>the SEVIS fee if you are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Seeking an initial J-1 visa from an embassy or consulate abroad for initial participation in an exchange visitor program.</li>
<li>A Canadian citizen who does not need a visa to enter the U.S. as an exchange visitor, but who will be applying for admission at a U.S.<span> </span>port of entry<span> </span>to begin initial participation in a Department of State-designated exchange visitor program.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Exceptions:</strong><span> </span>A fee is NOT required for a J-1 exchange visitor participating in a program sponsored by the U.S. federal government (i.e. J-1 DS-2019 was issued by USAID or Fulbright).</p>
<h4>SEVIS Fee Rules</h4>
<ol>
<li>The SEVIS fee must be processed at least three business days before the visa interview, unless you have a printed receipt from an internet payment.</li>
<li>The SEVIS fee cannot be paid at the embassy or consulate, or at the U.S. border.</li>
<li>A visa will not be issued unless the visa officer can verify that the SEVIS fee payment has been made. However, you may schedule your visa interview prior to paying the SEVIS fee.</li>
<li>The SEVIS fee is not refundable. If your visa application is denied and you decide to reapply for the same type of visa at a later date, you will not be asked to make a second SEVIS fee payment as long as your visa application is made within 12 months of the initial denial.</li>
</ol>
<h4>How to Pay the SEVIS Fee</h4>
<p>Currently, there are two payment methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Payment in U.S. dollars by credit card over the internet, or;</li>
<li>Payment in U.S. dollars by check, money order or bank draft, drawn on a U.S. bank and mailed to an address in the U.S.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Payment of the SEVIS fee may be made by you or by any other individual, either in the U.S. or abroad, including family or friends.<span> </span></strong>However, anyone paying the fee on your behalf will need to have<span> </span><strong>a copy of your DS-2019 form</strong> or<span> </span><strong>a completed copy of Form I-901</strong>.</p>
<h4>Procedure for Paying the SEVIS Fee</h4>
<ol>
<li>Obtain a DS-2019 from your sponsor.</li>

<li>Pay the $180.00 SEVIS fee according to one of the methods described below.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:<span> </span></strong>To complete Form I-901, you must enter two types of information:</p>
<ol>
<li>J-1 scholars need to enter the Syracuse University Program Number (see Item #2 of the DS-2019), and;</li>
<li>Enter your SEVIS I.D. number, which is printed at the top right of the DS-2019 form, above the bar code.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Paying on the Internet</h4>
<p>Once you have received your DS-2019, you can make the fee payment by<span> </span><a href="https://www.fmjfee.com/i901fee/index.html">submitting Form I-901 online</a><span> </span>using a credit card.</p>
<p>MasterCard, Visa or American Express debit or credit cards are accepted. It does not matter if the card was issued in the U.S. or overseas. Follow the online instructions, include the required credit card information and print out the payment screen to verify your payment. The printed receipt should be presented at the visa interview or at the U.S. port of entry as proof of payment. Thus, when paying the fee on the internet, it is essential that your printer be ready before starting the payment process. Do not exit the receipt page until you have successfully printed the receipt. You will not be able to return to the receipt page. For detailed information on the SEVIS fee payment process and for a list of frequently asked questions, visit U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement&#8217;s<span> </span><a href="https://www.ice.gov/sevis/i901">I-901 SEVIS Fee webpage</a>.</p>
<h4>Paying by Mail</h4>
<p>To pay by mail, you must<span> </span><a href="https://www.fmjfee.com/i901fee/index.html">download and print Form I-901</a>, or use a paper copy if provided with your DS-2019, fill out the form and mail it with your payment to the address below.</p>
<p>Your payment must be in U.S. dollars by check, money order or bank draft, drawn on a U.S. bank. Your check, bank draft or money order should be made payable to &#8220;I-901 Student/Exchange Visitor Processing Fee.&#8221; Also, be sure to print your name and SEVIS I.D. number in the lower lefthand corner of the check, money order or bank draft.</p>
<p>The need for a check, bank draft or money order in U.S. dollars, drawn on a U.S. bank, does not mean that only a U.S. bank can issue the document. Many foreign banks are able to issue checks or money orders drawn on a U.S. bank because they are chartered in the U.S., or because they are foreign subsidiaries of a U.S. bank, or because they have arrangements with a U.S. bank to issue a check, money order or foreign draft that is drawn on a U.S. bank.</p>
<p>Mail the payment and Form I-901 to:</p>
<p>I-901 Student/Exchange Visitor Visa Processing Fee<br />
P.O. Box 970020<br />
St. Louis, MO 63197-0020 USA</p>
<p>To send by courier, use the following address:</p>

<p>Phone Number:<span> </span><a href="tel:+13144188833">1.314.418.8833</a></p>
<p>(United States Country Code 011)</p>
<p>Please note,<strong><span> </span>payment by mail is not the recommended process for fee payment from abroad</strong> as it can take as long as four weeks from the day you mail in the fee to the day that you receive the required receipt in the mail if you are applying from outside the U.S., unless you pay for courier service.</p>
<h3 id="s:when-can-i-get-my-visa">When Can I Get My Visa and/or Enter the U.S.?</h3>
<p>The SEVIS fee must be paid and fully processed before the applicant arrives at the consulate for the visa interview. For those nonimmigrants who do not need a visa to enter the U.S. as an exchange visitor, the fee must be paid and fully processed before applying for entry at a U.S. port of entry.</p>
<p>A receipt will be sent by mail to the address that you indicate with your payment. Further, for those that pay the SEVIS fee online, a payment confirmation can be printed out immediately after the payment is made and used as a receipt until the mailed receipt is received.</p>
<p>Applicants are strongly encouraged to bring a SEVIS fee payment receipt with them for the visa interview or, for those that do not need a visa, to the U.S. port of entry. Having a receipt for the SEVIS fee payment will facilitate the visa application process. However, if you are unable to print a receipt from an online payment and/or do not receive your mailed receipt in time for your visa interview, you can still go to your interview as long as your fee has been processed by the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<h4>Showing Proof of SEVIS Fee Payment at the Visa Interview and/or the U.S. Port of Entry</h4>
<p>You must be able to prove that the fee has been paid when you appear for your visa interview and when you enter the United States. This is done by presenting a printed receipt, either from the internet if you made an online payment or a mailed receipt if you paid by mail.</p>
<p>Visa officers and U.S. port of entry inspectors should be able to verify SEVIS fee payment electronically three business days after payment is processed, but in case of problems, having a printed receipt is the best evidence of fee payment. If you lose or did not receive a receipt for fee payment, the U.S. government does retain an electronic record that the fee has been paid.</p>
<p><strong>The visa will not be issued unless verification of the SEVIS fee payment can be made.</strong></p>

<h3 id="s:complete-your-entry-paperwork">Complete Your Entry Paperwork</h3>
<p><strong>If Arriving By Air: </strong>Flight attendants will distribute Customs Declaration Forms (CF-6059) and Arrival-Departure Record Forms (I-94). These must be completed prior to landing.</p>
<p><strong>If Arriving By Land or Sea: </strong>The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the port of entry will provide the necessary Customs Declaration Forms (CF-6059) and Arrival-Departure Record Forms (I-94) to be filled out upon your arrival.</p>
<h3 id="s:as-you-arrive-at-the-port-of-entry">As You Arrive at the Port of Entry</h3>
<p>Proceed to the terminal area for arriving passengers. Have the following documents available for presentation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your passport;</li>
<li>Your DS-2019;</li>
<li>Arrival-Departure Record Form (I-94), and;</li>
<li>Customs Declaration Form (CF-6059).</li>
</ol>
<p>Form I-94 should reflect the address where you will reside, not the address of the program.</p>
<p>All visitors entering the United States must state their reason for wishing to enter the country. You will also be asked to provide information about your final destination. <strong>It is important for J-1 visa holders to tell the CBP officer that they will be an exchange visitor</strong>. Be prepared to include the name and address of Syracuse University.</p>
<p>Once your inspection is successfully completed, the inspecting officer will:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Return your SEVIS DS-2019.</li>
<li>Stamp the Arrival-Departure Record Form (I-94) with your date and port of entry, and then staple it in your passport.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s:following-admission-into-the-united-states">Following Admission Into the United States</h3>
<p>J-1 scholars must report to their Exchange Visitor Program sponsor within 30 days of the program start date identified in Line 3 of the DS-2019 to have their participation in the program activity validated. Failure to have participation validated will result in an automatic invalidated SEVIS record.</p>
<h3 id="s:additional-information">Additional Information</h3>
<h4>Secondary Inspection Requirements</h4>
<p>If the CBP officer at the port of entry cannot initially verify your information or you do not have all of the required documentation, you may be directed to an interview area known as “secondary inspection.” Secondary inspection allows inspectors to conduct additional research in order to verify information without causing delays for other arriving passengers.</p>
<p>It is important to answer all questions the CBP officer asks. Remember to remain calm. Secondary inspection is a normal process and is nothing to fear.</p>
<p>The CBP officer will first attempt to verify your status by using SEVIS. In the event that the CBP officer needs to verify your admission/participation with your sponsoring school or program, it is strongly recommended that you<span> </span><strong>have the name and telephone number of your foreign student advisor or J-1 Exchange Visitor Program sponsor available</strong>. In the event you arrive during non-business hours (evenings, weekends, holidays), you should also have the emergency phone number.</p>
<p><strong>Daytime Contact:<span> </span></strong>Center for International Services,<span> </span><a href="tel:+13154432457">315.443.2457</a></p>
<p><strong>After-Hours Emergency Contact:<span> </span></strong>Syracuse University Department of Public Safety,<span> </span><a href="tel:+13154432224">315.443.2224</a></p>
<p>Failure to comply with U.S. government entry-exit procedures may result in you being denied entry to the United States. Under certain circumstances, the CBP officer may issue a “Notice to Student or Exchange Visitor Form&#8221; (I-515A), which authorizes temporary admission into the United States for 30 days. If you are admitted with Form I-515A, you must work with your program sponsor or international advisor to submit proper documentation within that 30 day period.</p>
<h4>US-VISIT</h4>
<p>All nonimmigrant visitors holding visas<span>—</span>regardless of race, national origin or religion<span>—</span>participate in the US-VISIT, a comprehensive registration tracking system for entries to and exits from the United States. The program involves obtaining a scan of two index fingerprints and a digital photograph.</p>
<h4>Before Leaving the Inspections Area</h4>
<p>Make sure you have all of your documentation, including the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Passport</li>
<li>Departure Record (I-94 Card)</li>
<li>DS-2019</li>
<li>All supporting documents (letters, proof of finances, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="s:mandatory-check-in-and-orientation-for-all">Mandatory Check-In and Orientation For All New J-1 Scholars, Professors, Specialists and Interns</h3>
<p>Check-in and orientation for newly arrived J-1 scholars, professors, specialists and interns is very important. The Center for International Services must meet with all new J-1s within the first week of arrival on campus. During check-in, staff at the Center for International Services will advise new international employees on a variety of immigration issues as well as provide resources to assist with adjustment to life in Syracuse.</p>
<p>Topics typically covered during orientation include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Social Security number/Individual Taxpayer Identification Number applications</li>
<li>Banking</li>
<li>Health care and health insurance</li>
<li>Address reporting requirements</li>
<li>Travel requirements</li>
<li>Immigration regulations</li>
<li>Childcare and school resources</li>
<li>Programming activities and opportunities for involvement</li>
</ul>
<p>Check-in and orientation requires as much as an hour to complete. Prior to a new J-1’s arrival, the J-1 scholars or the host department must set up an appointment with the Center for International Services. Please contact the Center for International Services at<span> </span><a href="mailto:international@syr.edu">international@syr.edu</a> to schedule the appointment.</p>
<p>New J-1 scholars, professors, specialists and interns should bring the following items with them to their check-in and orientation appointment.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Passport</li>
<li>DS-2019</li>
<li>I-94 Card (the white card stamped at the port of entry that should be stapled inside your passport)</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="s:maintaining-your-passport">Maintaining Your Passport</h2>
<p>All international faculty, staff, scholars and students should maintain their passport validity. In general, it is best to have a passport that is valid for at least six months longer than the intended dates of stay. If renewal of a passport is necessary, check with your embassy or consulate about the renewal process.</p>
<h2 id="s:j-visa-health-insurance-requirement">J Visa Health Insurance Requirement</h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of State and the Exchange Visitor Program requires that all persons in J-1 or J-2 status have health insurance that meets the following minimum requirements.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Medical benefits of at least $100,000 per accident or illness;</li>
<li>A deductible not to exceed $500 per accident or illness;</li>
<li>Expenses associated with the medical evacuation of the exchange visitor to their home country in the amount of $50,000, and;</li>
<li>Repatriation of remains in the amount of $25,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>J-1 and J-2 exchange visitors must maintain their health insurance during the entire duration of their program. Persons who willfully fail to maintain coverage are subject to termination from the program.</p>
<p><strong>For full-time, paid Syracuse University employees ONLY:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>J-1 scholar researchers/professors who are paid by Syracuse University and are full-time employees are eligible for health insurance through the University.</li>
<li>The health insurance offered through the University meets the minimum requirements listed by the Department of State for medical benefits and for the deductible, but the insurance does not provide coverage for medical evacuation and repatriation of remains.</li>
<li>Call the Syracuse University Human Resources/Skytop Offices at<span> </span><a href="tel:+13154434042">315.443.4042</a><span> </span>to find out about your health insurance benefits.</li>
<li>If you receive health insurance as a benefit to your employment at the University, you will need a supplemental insurance policy that covers you for medical evacuation and repatriation. Applications can be obtained at the Center for International Services; the plan cost is $26.50 per year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For all other individuals utilizing personal or government funds who do not receive payment or health insurance from Syracuse University:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any J-1 scholar whose funding is from personal funds or a source other than Syracuse University will need to purchase a health insurance plan that will meet the minimum federal requirements.</li>
<li>J-1 scholars should plan to purchase the insurance upon arrival for both themselves and any J-2 dependents.</li>
<li>A Center for International Services advisor can provide you with information on health insurance plans that meet the minimum federal requirements.

<h2 id="s:report-address-changes">Report Address Changes</h2>
<p>All nonimmigrants (except those in A or G status) 14 years of age or older who will remain in the U.S. for 30 days or longer are required by law to notify the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) within 10 days of a change of physical address in the United States. The parent or legal guardian of a nonimmigrant child under the age of 14 is responsible for notifying DHS of the child&#8217;s change of address. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of immigration status that is punishable by fine or imprisonment and/or removal (“deportation”).</p>
<p>In order to comply with the address reporting requirement, J-1 visa holders are required by DHS to inform the Center for International Services at Syracuse University within 10 days of any change of your physical residence (apartment or home address) in the United States. Once you report your changes to the Center for International Services, we will report the new address to DHS through the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). Your physical residence is defined as where you live, not your school, lab or a P.O. Box. You should also report a separate mailing address (P.O. Box) if it is impossible for mail to be delivered to your physical residence, such as a University residence hall.</p>
<p>Human Resources and Syracuse University Payroll require student employees, faculty and staff to update any changes in their mailing address (P.O. Box or physical address where you can receive mail). This is to make sure that paychecks and payment information will be sent to the correct address. To update your mailing address, you must do so through<span> </span><a href="https://myslice.syr.edu/">Syracuse University’s MySlice service.</a></p>
<p>Verbal notice of a change of address to the Center for International Services does not constitute compliance with the SEVIS 10-day reporting requirement.</p>
<p>Filing a forwarding address with the U.S. Postal Service will not satisfy the reporting requirement for the Department of Homeland Security. Mail from the U.S. government will not be forwarded by the post office and will be returned to the issuing government agency as undeliverable. This is important for anyone who is waiting for a Social Security card from the Social Security Administration (SSA) or a change-of-status or employment authorization from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).</p>
<h3>A Note for Those With Pending Petitions at USCIS</h3>
<p>If you have an application currently pending with a DHS office, and it is pending with a DHS USCIS Service Center or other field office (i.e. for work authorization or petition for permanent residence), updating MySlice or filing the AR-11 online<span> </span><strong>will not</strong><span> </span>update your address with the respective DHS office that is handling your petition. You must inform USCIS separately in order to update your application address and ensure that you will receive notifications regarding your petition. Contact your advisor at the Center for International Services for instructions on the best way to inform these offices of your change of address.</p>
<h2>Obtain Travel Signature Prior to Travel Abroad and Reentry</h2>
<ul>
<li>J-1 and J-2 visa holders must obtain a travel signature on their DS-2019 from the Responsible Officer (RO) or Alternate Responsible Officer (ARO) (J-1 Scholar Advisor at the Center for International Services) in order to reenter the U.S. after any international travel.</li>
<li>Signatures are valid for up to one year (or up to six months for short-term scholars).</li>
<li>To reenter the United States in J visa status, you must carry your DS-2019 endorsed for travel, visa, I-94 card, passport and appointment letter.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be able to travel outside of and return to the United States in J status, you will need to have a valid signature from either the RO or ARO on the front page of your J-1 or J-2 DS-2019 Document in the Travel Validation Section.</p>
<p>Anyone in J-1 or J-2 status must visit or contact the Center for International Services at least one week before any travel out of the United States. One week is necessary to allow the Center advisor enough time to sign your documents and to make any necessary changes to your DS-2019 before your travel. Travel signatures are valid for one year (six months for short-term scholars) and must be valid on the date which you wish to return. Also, your DS-2019 must still be valid, meaning your program end date must not have passed in order to be able to reenter the United States.</p>
<p>Additionally, J-1 scholars seeking to reenter the United States must have a valid passport. Your passport must be valid for at least six months after the date you intend to return to the United States. If your passport is expiring, you should make plans to renew or extend your passport before your travel.</p>
<p>With the exception of visits to Canada, Mexico and the adjacent Caribbean islands that last less than 30 days [22 C.F.R. § 41.112(d); 8 C.F.R. § 214.1 (b) (1)], you will also need to have a valid J-1 or J-2 visa stamp in your passport to be able to return to the United States. The J-1 and J-2 visa stamps cannot be obtained within the United States. Visa appointments must be made with a consulate or embassy outside of the United States for the renewal or initial J visa.</p>
<h3>Visa Requirements for Transit Through and Travel to Other Countries</h3>
<p>Traveling through/to another country may involve obtaining a transit/entry visa to that country. It is best to check the consulate website of the country you wish to visit to get the current visa procedures.</p>
<h3>Travel to Canada, Mexico and the Adjacent Islands for Those in J-Visa Status</h3>
<p>For visits to Canada, Mexico and a limited number of adjacent Caribbean islands that last less than 30 days [22 C.F.R. § 41.112(d); 8 C.F.R. § 214.1 (b) (1)], it is possible to return to the United States without having to renew an expired U.S. visa stamp.</p>

<p>Note: Citizens of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria are not eligible for automatic visa revalidation and must always have a valid U.S. visa stamp in order to return to the United States.</p>
<p>Please remember that based on your citizenship, you may be required to obtain a visa to enter Canada, Mexico or the adjacent Caribbean islands.</p>

<ul>
<li>J-1s cannot hold a tenure track position.</li>
<li>Maximum period of participation in a J Program:
<ul>
<li>J-1 professor or research scholar: Continuous five-year period on a “use or lose” basis.</li>
<li>J-1 specialist or student intern: One year.</li>
<li>J-1 short-term scholars: Six months.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Notify your academic department and an advisor at the Center for International Services 1-2 months before the end date indicated on your DS-2019 in order for us to process an extension.</li>
<li>All extensions must be completed in the SEVIS system before the end date on your DS-2019.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>It is important to keep the information on your DS-2019 current. You must always have valid dates of stay; your dates of stay are listed in Section 3 of your DS-2019. The I-94 of an exchange visitor should be marked D/S (duration-of-status), which means that the J visa holder is legally in the United States as long as they are performing the activities listed on the DS-2019, the DS-2019 has not expired and the J-1 exchange visitor has not violated Exchange Program rules. The I-94 is the white card that should be stapled inside your passport next to the most current J-1 visa stamp.</span></p>
<p>Exchange visitors can also remain in the U.S. for an additional 30 days beyond the expiration date on the DS-2019, provided they are in legal status. The 30-day grace period is meant to allow the J visa holder time for travel and preparation for departure. The exchange visitor may not work during this period.</p>
<p>Extensions of stay may be possible if you have not exceeded the time allowed under your J-1 status. To process an extension, you will need to fill out the J-1 Extension Form, which is available on the<span> </span><a href="https://experience.syracuse.edu/intercultural-collective/center-for-international-services/forms/">Forms page</a><span> </span>of this website.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: You are not eligible for an extension if you have obtained a waiver or recommendation of waiver of the two-year home residency requirement.</strong></p>
<h2 id="s:transferring-to-another-program-as-a">Transferring to Another Program as a J-1</h2>
<p>An exchange visitor can transfer to another program sponsor (i.e. transfer to another university) if:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The purpose of the program remains the same (same general subject area).</li>
<li>The visitor will remain in the same category (i.e. professor will remain a professor).</li>
<li>The visitor has not reached the maximum stay limit:
<ul type="disc">
<li>Five years for research scholar/professor.</li>
<li>One year for specialist.</li>
<li>One year for student intern.</li>
<li>Six months for short-term scholar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The visitor has not obtained a waiver of the two-year home residency requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to transfer, written release is needed from the current J-1 sponsor. Please complete the J-1 Scholar Transfer Out Form, available on the<span> </span><a href="https://experience.syracuse.edu/intercultural-collective/center-for-international-services/forms/">Forms page</a><span> </span>of this website, and submit it to the Center for International Services.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: You are not eligible for transfer if you have obtained a waiver or recommendation of waiver of the two-year home residency requirement.</strong></p>
<h2 id="s:j-1-occasional-lectures-or-consultations">J-1 Occasional Lectures or Consultations</h2>
<p>J-1 scholars may participate in occasional lectures and short-term consultations outside of Syracuse University, but they must have the <strong>advance permission</strong><span> </span>of their J Program sponsor. Such lectures and consultations must be incidental to the exchange visitor’s primary program activities. If wages or other remunerations are received for such activities, the exchange visitor must act as an independent contractor [22CFR 514.20(g)].</p>
<p>To get permission to conduct off-campus lectures or consultations that will involve wages or other payment, you should bring the following to the Center for International Services before beginning such activities.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Letter from the inviting organization stating terms and conditions of the consultation/lecture, including dates, hours, purpose of work, amount of pay and summary of responsibilities.</li>
<li>Letter from your Syracuse University academic department recommending that you participate in the lecture or consultation and explaining how the activity fits in with your exchange visitor program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon receipt of the above, one of the AROs at the Center for International Services will issue a letter certifying that the occasional lecture/consultation has been approved.</p>

        <p>The Center for International Services is the office responsible for issuing visa documents for professors and researchers from abroad to visit Syracuse University. In consultation with the Syracuse University host department, the Center will determine the most appropriate immigration status for your work at Syracuse University.</p>
<p>Before the Center for International Services may process any initial or extension of visa support for a visiting international professor or researcher, you must be invited or have your invitation extended by a Syracuse University department, which will serve as your host. For new or continuing paid employees of Syracuse University, this means that an approved job offer and appointment letter must be signed before sponsorship or extension. For independently funded, unpaid visiting researchers, an invitation letter must be prepared before visa sponsorship or extension.</p>

<h2 id="s:overview-of-j-1-visa">Overview of J-1 Visa</h2>
<p>The J-1 category is for persons who are coming to the U.S. for a short-term program in a variety of different areas: study, long-term research, short-term research, teaching and training. Syracuse University authorizes documents only for professors, research scholars, specialists, student interns and students. The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) DS-2019 is the document issued by the Center for International Services to any person approved by Syracuse University for a J-1 program.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the J Program is a temporary program and that J visa holders should have no immigrant intent. This visa category should not be used by departments or internationals for permanent employment positions or to seek permanent residency in the United States.</p>
<p>The J Exchange Visitor classification authorized by I.N.A. § 101(a)(15)(J) was developed to implement the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act (Fulbright-Hayes Act) of 1961 [Public Law 87-256, as amended, 22 U.S.C. § 2451, et seq.]. The overall purpose of that Act and the objective of the Exchange Visitor classification is “to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational and cultural exchanges.” The Department of State issues J visas and establishes and administers the federal regulations and policies governing the J Exchange Visitor Program.</p>

<h4>SEVIS Fee</h4>
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security charges all new J-1 Scholars and Professors a $180 fee to cover the costs of the SEVIS, a central database that manages information related to visitors’ immigration status while in the United States.

<h4>Visa Fees</h4>
<p>In addition to the SEVIS fee, the prospective J-1 must pay certain visa fees.<span> </span><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/exchange.html#fees">Please see the Department of State website for more information on fee amounts</a><a href="http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1263.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>.

<h3>Step 1: Instructions for the J-1 Applicant</h3>
<p>The J-1 Applicant should complete Sections 1, 2 and 3 of the<span> </span><a href="https://experience.syracuse.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2020/12/J-1_Scholar_Application_Packet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">J-1 Scholar Application Packet</a> and sign the statement at the end of Section 3.</p>
<p>In addition to Sections 1, 2 and 3 of this form, the J-1 applicant should submit the following materials to their host department.</p>
<ul>
<li>A copy/scan of the J-1 applicant’s main passport information page (and the main passport page for each J-2 dependent family member who will accompany the J-1 to the U.S.).</li>
<li>If the applicant will be supported by personal funding or by funding from an institute or organization other than Syracuse University, the applicant must include any necessary financial documentation (award letter, bank statement, salary letter, etc.) and indicate the sources of funding in Section 2. The amount should be at least $1,200/month for the J-1 applicant and $500/month for each dependent J-2 spouse or child(ren).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2: Instructions for the Department</h3>
<p>After receiving all documents from the J-1 applicant, the department should complete Section 4 and submit the entire<span> </span><a href="https://experience.syracuse.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2020/12/J-1_Scholar_Application_Packet.pdf">J-1 Scholar Application Packet</a><span> </span>(Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4), along with any accompanying financial documentation and passport copies to the Center for International Services.</p>
<p>Departments must also include a copy of an appointment letter for any incoming J-1 Scholar or Professor. The appointment letter is required for both paid and unpaid visiting Scholars and Professors.</p>
<p>Please submit all of the requested information. The Center must have these materials in order to process your request for your prospective J-1 applicant’s immigration documents.</p>
<p><strong>Note to Applicants and Departments:<span> </span></strong>Syracuse University will not provide J-1 sponsorship longer than one year at a time for independently funded Scholars; independently funded Scholars must seek an annual extension of their J-1 sponsorship for continuance of their program.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Center for International Services</h3>
<p>After receiving all documents from the J-1 applicant and department as well as the proof of finances, the Center for International Services will process the DS-2019 Forms for the J-1 Scholar or Professor and for all J-2 dependents in the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services SEVIS Database.</p>
<p>Along with the DS-2019(s), the Center for International Services will prepare a packet for the J-1 applicant which will include a cover letter with information about the J-1 Exchange Visitor Program, paying the SEVIS fee, obtaining the J-1 visa, travel to the United States and general information about Syracuse University and the city of Syracuse. The department will be asked to send this information along with the department’s appointment letter to the J-1 applicant (likewise, the Center can ship items if provided with an express mail account).</p>
<h4>Processing Time</h4>
<p>Allow at least one week for the Center for International Services to process and prepare all supporting documents. Overall processing time for the scholar to obtain a J-1 visa and arrive in the U.S. is a minimum of at least eight weeks (more if there are delays due to Technology Alert List or background checks).</p>
<h2 id="s:j-1-extensions">J-1 Extensions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Timing: Departments and Scholars should notify the Center for International Services 1-2 months before the end date indicated on the J-1 DS-2019 in order to process an extension on time.</li>
<li>All extensions must be completed in the SEVIS system before the end date on your DS-2019.</li>
<li>Maximum period of participation in a J Program:
<ul>
<li>J-1 Professor or Research Scholar: Continuous five-year period on a “use or lose” basis.</li>
<li>J-1 Specialist or Student Intern: One year.</li>
<li>J-1 Short-Term Scholar: Six months.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Extensions of stay may be possible if the J-1 Exchange Visitor has not exceeded the time allowed under their J-1 status. To process an extension, both the department and the J-1 Exchange Visitor will need to complete the<span> </span>J-1 Extension Form and submit it with an updated appointment letter to the Center for International Services. The J-1 Extension Form<span> </span>and the J-1 Student Intern Evaluation<span> </span>forms are available on the<span> </span><a href="https://experience.syracuse.edu/intercultural-collective/center-for-international-services/forms/">Forms webpage</a>.</p>
<p><strong>30-Day Grace Period:</strong><span> </span>Exchange visitors can also remain in the U.S. for an additional 30 days beyond the expiration date on the DS-2019 provided they are in legal status. The 30-day grace period is meant to allow the J visa holder time for travel and preparation for departure. The exchange visitor<span> </span><strong>may not work</strong> during this period.</p>
<p><strong>Note: You are not eligible for extension if you have obtained a waiver or recommendation of waiver of the two-year home residency requirement.</strong></p>
<h2 id="s:j-1-transfer-to-another-program-as">J-1 Transfer to Another Program as a J-1</h2>
<p>An exchange visitor can transfer to another program sponsor (i.e. transfer to another university) if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of the program remains the same (same general subject area).</li>
<li>The visitor will remain in the same category (i.e. Professor will remain a Professor).</li>
<li>The visitor has not reached the maximum stay limit:
<ul>
<li>Five years for Research Scholar/Professor.</li>
<li>One year for Specialist.</li>
<li>One year for Student Intern.</li>
<li>Six months for Short-Term Scholar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The visitor has not obtained a waiver of the two-year home residency requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to transfer, written release is needed from the current J-1 sponsor. To process the transfer, the J-1 Scholar and the new host institution’s J-1 advisor must complete the<span> </span>J-1 Scholar Transfer-Out Form, which is available on the<span> </span><a href="https://experience.syracuse.edu/intercultural-collective/center-for-international-services/forms/">Forms webpage</a>, and submit it to the c.</p>

        <h2 id="s:program-administration">Program Administration</h2>
<p>Departments planning to host J-1 Student Interns are responsible for developing the internship plan, evaluating Intern participation and supporting the Intern through faculty mentorship and other assistance, such as locating suitable accommodations. The Center for International Services, designated by the University and the U.S. Department of State as administrators of the University’s J-1 program, will assist departments and Interns in producing the immigration paperwork (Form DS-2019) required for the Intern’s visa, admittance to the U.S. and maintenance of valid immigration status.</p>
<h2 id="s:program-requirements-and-prohibitions">Program Requirements and Prohibitions<span class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></span></h2>
<p>The Department of State has established the following requirements and prohibitions for participation in the J-1 Student Intern program.</p>
<ul>
<li>The internship must consist of a minimum of 32 hours per week of internship activity, no more than 20 percent of which consists of clerical work.</li>
<li>The internship must fulfill the educational objectives for the Intern’s current degree program at their home institution. It must expose the participant to U.S. techniques, methodologies and technology. Additionally, it must expand upon the Intern’s existing knowledge and skills, and not duplicate the Student Intern’s prior experience.</li>
<li>A Student Intern may be paid or unpaid. To be employed, however, the Student Intern must receive approval from their home institution’s dean or academic advisor.</li>
<li>The internship must not place the intern in any position that involves any of the following:
<ul>
<li>Unskilled or casual labor.</li>
<li>Child care or elder care.</li>
<li>Aviation.</li>
<li>Clinical positions or any other kind of work involving patient care or contact, including therapy, medication, or other clinical or medical care (e.g., sports or physical therapy, psychological counseling, nursing, dentistry, veterinary medicine, social work, speech therapy or early childhood education).</li>
<li>Any “position, occupation, or business that could bring the Exchange Visitor Program or the Department [of State] into notoriety or disrepute” [22 CFR § 62.23(i)(7)(iii)].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The internship cannot serve to fill a labor need. It must exist solely to assist the Student Intern in achieving the objectives of their participation in a student internship program. The internship must consist of work-based learning, rather than ordinary employment or unskilled labor.</li>
<li>The internship cannot displace American workers, whether full- or part-time, temporary or permanent.</li>
<li>If in the field of agriculture, the internship must meet all requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="s:financial-support-required">Financial Support Required</h2>
<p>Host departments must verify that the Student Intern and any accompanying dependents will have sufficient funding for the entire length of stay. The minimum amount of financial support for an Intern is $1,200 per month, plus $500 per month for each accompanying J-2 dependent spouse or child. The internship may be paid or unpaid. If the department will pay the Intern a salary or stipend, then the amount of financial support should be noted in the letter of invitation. If the internship will be unpaid, then the Intern must submit evidence of financial support in the form of a bank statement or a sponsor letter.</p>

<p>Interns must provide proof of health insurance for themselves and any family members when they first arrive and report to the Center for International Services, and again if they later apply for an extension of their J-1 status. Interns may purchase any plan that provides the minimum level of coverage listed above.</p>
<h2 id="s:mandatory-evaluation-of-j-1-interns">Mandatory Evaluation of J-1 Interns</h2>
<p>Department of State regulations require that an evaluation be completed for each J-1 Student Intern at the end of their internship. Internships that last longer than six months also require at least one additional mid-program evaluation, to be undertaken at the midpoint of the program. The<span> </span>J-1 Student Intern Evaluation Form is available on the<span> </span><a href="https://experience.syracuse.edu/intercultural-collective/center-for-international-services/forms/">Forms webpage</a>.</p>
<h2 id="s:application-steps">Application Steps</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Instructions for the Student Intern Applicant</h3>
<p>The J-1 Student Intern applicant should complete Sections 1, 2 and 3 of the<span> </span>J-1 Student Intern Packet,<span> available on the <a href="https://experience.syracuse.edu/intercultural-collective/center-for-international-services/forms/">Forms webpage</a>, and s</span>ign the statement at the end of Section 3. Once the J-1 Student Intern applicant has completed Sections 1, 2 and 3, they should submit the form and supporting documents directly to the Syracuse University department that will host them.</p>
<p>In addition to Sections 1, 2 and 3 of this form, the J-1 Student Intern applicant should submit the following materials to their host department.</p>
<ul>
<li>A copy/scan of the J-1 Student Intern applicant’s main passport information page.</li>
<li>A letter from an English language instructor at the Intern applicant&#8217;s institution or an English language school verifying that the Intern applicant has sufficient language skills to “function on a day-to-day basis in the internship environment.”
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, the Intern applicant can provide evidence of passing a recognized language test such as the TOEFL or IELTS. The minimum TOEFL score required on the written test is 550 and on the internet-based test (iBT) is 80. The minimum IELTS score is 6.5.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the Intern<span> </span><strong>will be paid</strong><span> </span>by Syracuse University, then the Intern applicant must submit a letter from the dean or academic advisor from their home institution that authorizes the employment.</li>
<li>If the Intern<span> </span><strong>will not be paid</strong><span> </span>by Syracuse University, the J-1 Student Intern applicant must submit proof of adequate financial support and provide copies to the Center for International Services. The amount should be at least $1,200/month for the J-1 Student Intern applicant and $500/month for each dependent J-2 spouse or child(ren).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2: Instructions for the Department</h3>
<p>After receiving all documents from the J-1 applicant, the department should complete Section 4 and submit the entire J-1 Student Intern Packet<span> </span>(Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4; packet available on the<span> </span><a href="https://experience.syracuse.edu/intercultural-collective/center-for-international-services/forms/">Forms webpage</a>) along with any accompanying financial documentation and passport copies to the Center for International Services.</p>
<p>In addition to this form, departments are required to provide the following materials.</p>
<ul>
<li>An invitation letter on department letterhead inviting the J-1 Student Intern to come to Syracuse University as a visiting Student Intern.</li>
<li>A Training/Internship Placement Plan (DS-7002) for each Intern.
<ul>
<li>An<span> </span><a href="https://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds7002.PDF">online, fillable version of this form</a><span> </span>is available.</li>
<li>Please complete the DS-7002 form and sign under &#8220;Supervisor&#8217;s Signature,&#8221; but leave &#8220;Sponsor&#8217;s Signature&#8221; and &#8220;Program Number&#8221; blank. The Center for International Services will complete that portion of the DS-7002.</li>
<li>The Center for International Services will send the form to the J-1 Student Intern with the other visa support documents. The J-1 Student Intern will need this form when they apply for their visa.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please submit all of the requested information. The Center for International Services must have these materials in order to process your request for your prospective Intern’s immigration documents.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Center for International Services</h3>
<p>After receiving all documents from the J-1 applicant and department as well as the supporting documents, the Center for International Services will process the DS-2019 Forms for the J-1 Student Intern and for all J-2 dependents in the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services SEVIS Database.</p>
<p>Along with the DS-2019(s), the Center for International Services will prepare a packet for the J-1 Student Intern applicant that will include an invitation letter and information about the J-1 Exchange Visitor Program, paying the SEVIS fee, obtaining the J-1 visa, travel to the United States and general information Syracuse University and the city of Syracuse. The department will be asked to send this information along with the department’s appointment letter to the J-1 applicant (likewise, the Center can ship items if provided with an express mail account).</p>
<h3>Processing Time—Plan Two Months in Advance</h3>
<p>After submission of the complete J-1 Student Intern Application, please allow at least one week for the Center for International Services to process and prepare all supporting J-1 visa documents.</p>
<p>Overall processing time for the Student Intern to obtain a J-1 visa and arrive in the U.S. is a minimum of at least eight weeks (more if there are delays due to Technology Alert List or background checks).</p>
<h2 id="s:j-1-intern-extensions">J-1 Intern Extensions</h2>
<p>Extensions of stay may be possible if the J-1 Student Intern has not exceeded the one year allowed under their J-1 status. To process an extension, both the department and the J-1 Student Intern will need to complete the<span> </span>J-1 Extension Form<span> </span>and submit it, along with a<span> </span>J-1 Student Intern Evaluation and an updated appointment letter to the Center for International Services. The J-1 Extension Form and the J-1 Student Intern Evaluation Form<span> </span>are available on the<span> </span><a href="https://experience.syracuse.edu/intercultural-collective/center-for-international-services/forms/">Forms webpage</a>.</p>
<h3>Timing</h3>
<p>Departments and Interns should notify the Center 1-2 months before the end date indicated on the J-1 DS-2019 in order to process an extension on time.<span> </span><strong>All extensions must be completed in the SEVIS system before the end date on your DS-2019.</strong></p>
<h3>30-Day Grace Period</h3>
<p>J-1 Student Interns can remain in the U.S. for an additional 30 days beyond the expiration date on the DS-2019 provided they are in legal status. The 30-day grace period is meant to allow the J visa holder time for travel and preparation for departure. The exchange visitor<span> </span><strong>may not work</strong> during this period.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: You are not eligible for extension if you have obtained a waiver or recommendation of waiver of the two-year home residency requirement.</strong></p>
<h2 id="s:j-1-transfer-to-another-program-as">J-1 Transfer to Another Program as a J-1 Student Intern</h2>
<p>An exchange visitor can transfer to another program sponsor (i.e. transfer to another university) if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of the program remains the same (same general subject area).</li>
<li>The visitor will remain as a Student Intern.</li>
<li>The visitor has not reached the maximum stay limit (one year for Student Interns).</li>
<li>The visitor has not obtained a waiver of the two-year home residency requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to transfer, written release is needed from the current J-1 sponsor. To process the transfer, the J-1 Student Intern and the new host institution’s J-1 advisor must complete the J-1 Scholar Transfer-Out<span> </span>Form, which is available on the<span> </span><a href="https://experience.syracuse.edu/intercultural-collective/center-for-international-services/forms/">Forms webpage</a><a href="http://international.syr.edu/forms/index.html">,</a><span> </span>and submit it to the Center.</p>
<p><strong>Note: You are not eligible for transfer if you have obtained a waiver or recommendation of waiver of the two-year home residency requirement.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>1.1<span> </span></strong>Syracuse University is an institution of higher learning where individual growth and development are fostered, excellence is pursued, and the highest standards of integrity are expected in all areas of life. Syracuse University is committed to providing an environment where persons are physically safe, property is secure, individual rights of all persons are respected, and education of the highest quality is achieved.</p>
<p><strong>1.2<span> </span></strong>The Trustees and Chancellor of Syracuse University have delegated authority to the University Student Conduct System to adjudicate cases alleging violations of the Student Conduct Code by Syracuse University students and student organizations. The procedures outlined in this handbook apply to the resolution of alleged misconduct in violation of the Code or other University policies, as well as any related matters. Academic integrity cases are handled through a separate process administered by the Center for Learning and Student Success (CLASS).</p>
<p><strong>1.3<span> </span></strong>Oversight of the Student Conduct System is the responsibility of the Senior Vice President and Chief Student Experience Officer. Implementation of these procedures is the responsibility of Community Standards. The Student Conduct Code outlines the behavior that is expected of all students at Syracuse University. Having voluntarily enrolled at Syracuse University, all students have entered into an agreement to abide by the rules and regulations set forth in the Student Conduct Code and other University policies. Each student is responsible for conforming their conduct to the requirements of this code and applicable federal, state, and local laws.</p>
<p><strong>1.4<span> </span></strong>Syracuse University considers its Student Conduct Code as a statement of minimal expectations and seeks to foster a commitment to the highest standards of ethical behavior by the coherent, consistent, and fair way it enforces its rules and regulations. The University views its student conduct process as a learning experience that is intended to result in personal growth, empathy, and understanding.</p>
<p><strong>1.5<span> </span></strong>Timeframes mentioned in these procedures are estimates only. Conduct cases and specific components of cases may take shorter or longer depending on various factors, including but not limited to, the nature and complexity of the case; availability of parties and witnesses; time of year; numbers of parties; etc.</p>

        <p><strong>2.1<span> </span></strong>University Student Conduct System has jurisdiction over all alleged violations of the Student Conduct Code by any student or student organization that may be brought to its attention. Students and student organizations may be responsible for the conduct of their guests. Jurisdiction extends to alleged misconduct that takes place: on University owned or operated property or on property that is the temporary or permanent residence of a student, including Greek Letter Organization chapter houses; at any University sponsored event, program, or activity; and at any location off campus and/or virtually if the alleged misconduct has an adverse impact on the educational mission or well-being of the University Community. The Student Conduct Code applies from the time of a student&#8217;s acceptance of admission until the time they graduate or otherwise permanently separate from the University including all university breaks and holidays. Admitted students who have not yet matriculated are not entitled to the procedures described in this Student Conduct System Handbook, and the University reserves the right to revoke admission for any conduct pre-matriculation that demonstrates poor citizenship and character as determined in the University’s sole discretion.</p>
<p><strong>2.2</strong><span> </span>The Student Conduct System has jurisdiction over complaints against students alleging sex discrimination including sexual and gender-based harassment, assault, and violence. The Syracuse University<span> </span><a href="https://policies.syr.edu/policies/university-governance-ethics-integrity-and-legal-compliance/sexual-harassment-abuse-and-assault-prevention/">Sexual Harassment, Abuse, and Assault Prevention Policy</a><span> </span>applies to all University programs and activities, and the conduct<span> </span><a href="https://policies.syr.edu/policies/university-governance-ethics-integrity-and-legal-compliance/sexual-harassment-abuse-and-assault-prevention/student-procedures/">procedures for cases of sexual harassment</a><span> </span>are available on the<span> </span><a href="https://policies.syr.edu/policies/university-governance-ethics-integrity-and-legal-compliance/sexual-harassment-abuse-and-assault-prevention/student-procedures/">University policies website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2.3<span> </span></strong>University student conduct proceedings are administrative in nature and independent of any criminal and/or civil legal proceedings, even when those proceedings are concurrently in process. Student conduct proceedings use the Preponderance of the Evidence, or “More Likely Than Not” standard of proof and are intended to enforce the Student Conduct Code and other University policies at Syracuse University. The University may notify local and federal authorities when a crime is alleged to have been committed. The legal rules of evidence do not apply in the University conduct process.</p>

        <p><b>The University may impose certain immediate actions while alleged policy violations are investigated and/or conduct charges are pending. These interim measures are not disciplinary outcomes but are utilized to promote safety and prevent negative incidents and interactions.</b></p>
<p><strong>4.1<span> </span></strong>The Dean of Students, or designee, determines if an interim suspension or other provisional measures should be imposed. This action may be taken to promote the safety and well-being of the University community or where a student on probation as a result of a Student Conduct Code violation commits a similar infraction, demonstrating an unwillingness to comply with University policy. Interim suspension limits a student’s ability to be physically present on University property, participate in classes, and participate in all University activities. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, a student who is interim suspended will be notified of any alleged policy violations within three (3) business days of the transmittal of the interim suspension notice. Alleged policy violations are subject to change depending on the information gathered during an investigation. All efforts will be made to investigate the incident further and proceed with the student conduct process in a timely fashion.</p>
<p><strong>4.2<span> </span></strong>A student who is placed on interim suspension will be given the opportunity to appeal their interim suspension to the University Appeals Board. Any appeal must be made by the student in writing within five (5) business days of the notice of the interim suspension. Within three (3) business days of receipt of the student’s written appeal, the University Appeals Board will review the case, including the student’s written appeal and the Dean of Students or designee’s articulated basis for imposing the interim suspension, to determine whether the interim suspension was appropriate at the time it was issued, and/or if it should be continued or modified.</p>
<p><strong>4.3<span> </span></strong>The University Appeals Board will decide the appeal on the written materials only. The University Appeals Board will make a preliminary determination within three (3) business days of the review and transmit that preliminary determination to the Senior Vice President and Chief Student Experience Officer, or designee. The Senior Vice President and Chief Student Experience Officer, or designee, will review the preliminary decision of the University Appeals Board and may affirm, modify, or return it for further proceedings. The Senior Vice President and Chief Student Experience Officer’s decision will be communicated to the student within three (3) business days of receipt of the preliminary determination by the University Appeals Board, and that decision is final and subject to no further institutional process or review.</p>
<p><strong>4.4<span> </span></strong>If the student does not appeal the interim suspension, the interim suspension remains in effect pending the outcome of a resolution by agreement meeting or final outcome of a formal hearing and any subsequent appeal. The interim suspension may be rescinded or modified by the Dean of Students, or designee, at any time, in the Dean’s or designee’s discretion.</p>
<p>Where an interim suspension or other measures are imposed in a case involving the arrest of the Respondent, the University may require the associated criminal matter to be resolved in full prior to the pending conduct case being heard. In cases of sexual misconduct, the University may be required to proceed with the conduct case prior to resolution of an associated criminal matter.</p>
<p><strong>4.5</strong><span> </span>Investigative Status is an interim measure imposed on a student organization to protect the safety, security, or well-being of all members of the University Community. A student organization placed on Investigative Status is prohibited from engaging in any organizational activities until a full investigation and any resulting conduct complaint are concluded, or until the Investigative Status is otherwise lifted or modified at the discretion of the Director of Community Standards.</p>
<p><strong>4.6<span> </span></strong>No Contact Orders (NCO) are issued to prohibit communication between designated students when there is reason to believe that continued contact is not in the best interest of the involved students. NCOs are not considered disciplinary action and are intended to promote student safety and security, and to prevent future negative interactions between the students.</p>
<p>No Contact Orders prohibit all forms of contact between students including, but not limited to, contact via social media, electronic communications, contact via a third-party proxy and/or in-person contact.</p>
<p><strong>4.7<span> </span></strong>Temporary No Contact Orders may be issued as a temporary directive to prohibit communication between designated students when there is reason to believe continued contact is not in the best interest of the involved students. Temporary NCOs will be reviewed by the Director of Community Standards, or designee, within two (2) business days of being issued to determine if there is a need to continue the NCO, amend it, or remove it. Both parties will be notified in writing of the decision.</p>
<p><strong>4.8<span> </span></strong>When a No Contact Order is issued, all parties will receive a written copy of the NCO electronically via their University email address. The University official issuing the NCO (usually a staff member in the Student Experience Division) will review the meaning and impact of the NCO with each student. This may occur in person, via teleconference, or phone. All parties named in an NCO are expected to avoid contact with the other. NCOs typically impose mutual restrictions on the parties.</p>
<p><strong>4.9<span> </span></strong>No Contact Orders remain in place unless: amended or rescinded by the Dean of Students, or designee; or upon a request for reconsideration as outlined in Part 4.10; or by the University Conduct Board, Administrative Hearing Officer, or University Appeals Board after the resolution of a conduct case, as appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>4.10<span> </span></strong>No Contact Orders may be removed or amended at the discretion of the Dean of Students, or designee, through request for reconsideration submitted to Community Standards by either party. In the event of a request for reconsideration, either involved student may submit a written request to have the NCO removed or amended. The request must include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>A description of the events that caused the NCO to be issued.</li>
<li>Names of those listed on the NCO.</li>
<li>Reasons why the NCO should be removed or amended.</li>
<li>Plans to prevent any negative incidents from occurring between parties listed if the NCO is removed or amended.</li>
</ol>
<p>When a request for reconsideration has been filed, the other party(ies) to the NCO may be permitted to respond in writing within three (3) business days after the request has been provided to them.

<p><strong>5.1<span> </span></strong>Complainants and Respondents may elect to be advised throughout the conduct process by a Procedural Advisor. Except in cases involving sex-based discrimination or sexual misconduct, persons who may serve as Procedural Advisors are limited to full-time students, faculty, and staff of Syracuse University. Parents/guardians, external attorneys, and fact witnesses may not serve as Procedural Advisors.</p>
<p>Community Standards maintains a pool of trained University community members who may be available to provide procedural advice and support to Complainants and Respondents in conduct cases. A Procedural Advisor from the Community Standards pool is based on availability and is not guaranteed. Students may always elect to choose a Procedural Advisor who is a student, faculty, or staff member outside the pool. Community Standards will assign a Procedural Advisor for all Formal Hearings unless a student declines or wishes to have an alternate advisor of their choice. In such cases, it is the student&#8217;s responsibility to ensure their advisor is available for their scheduled hearing.</p>
<p><strong>5.2</strong><span> </span>In cases involving sex-based discrimination or sexual misconduct, Complainants and Respondents may be advised by advisors of their choice, including attorneys, throughout all phases of an investigation and conduct process.

<p><strong>6.1<span> </span></strong>Student Conduct Investigation Process &#8211; Once a report has been submitted to Community Standards, it may be referred for further investigation at the discretion of the Director of Community Standards or designee if additional information is needed.</p>
<p><strong>6.2<span> </span></strong>Investigation Initiated – If an investigation is required, the Student Conduct Investigator may contact the reporting party to make them aware that an investigation is taking place. The Student Conduct Investigator will attempt to collect any essential information from the reporting party.</p>
<p><strong>6.3<span> </span></strong>Notification – If it is determined that interviews are required as a part of an investigation, students will be notified of the date, time, and location of their interview through their Syracuse University email account. Students who fail to attend their investigation interview meeting may be charged with violating Section 12 of the Student Code of Conduct for failure to comply.</p>
<p><strong>6.4<span> </span></strong>Interviews – When conducting interviews, an Investigator will review the student’s rights at the beginning and remind students that participation is voluntary. If the student chooses to participate in the interview, the student may answer questions asked by the Investigator. Relevant information shared with the Investigator will be part of the investigation report written by the Investigator at the conclusion of the investigation. Students who participate in an investigation interview will be provided the opportunity to review their interview summary statement written by the Investigator at the conclusion of the Investigation.</p>
<p><strong>6.5<span> </span></strong>Investigation Report &#8211; At the end of the investigation, an investigation report is written and submitted to the Director of Community Standards.

<p><strong>7.1<span> </span></strong>Reports alleging violations of the Student Conduct Code or other University policies may be submitted to Community Standards by anyone. All reports are reviewed by the Director of Community Standards or designee to determine if the alleged conduct, if proven, would violate the Code or other University policy. Reports may be dismissed outright, referred to an investigator if additional information is needed, or referred to a conduct officer for possible resolution by agreement.</p>
<p><strong>7.2<span> </span></strong>When there is enough information to move forward with the conduct process, the case will proceed to resolution by agreement, and the subject(s) of the report will receive a meeting request at their Syracuse University email. The letter will include a summary of the alleged incident, the alleged violations of the Student Conduct Code, information regarding support from Procedural Advisors, the process to request disability accommodations, the process for requesting a copy of the report, and the date/time/location of the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>7.3<span> </span></strong>Students may be accompanied by a Procedural Advisor during any meeting regarding resolution of their case. Procedural Advisors may be any faculty member, staff member, or student; external attorneys are not permitted to serve as Procedural Advisors as outlined in Part 5.</p>
<p><strong>7.4<span> </span></strong>Resolution by Agreement meetings are not recorded, and recording devices are not permitted. However, students may take notes during the meeting. At the beginning of a resolution meeting, a student will be provided with the following information by a conduct officer:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Student’s rights and responsibilities.</li>
<li>Overview of the conduct process.</li>
<li>Resolution options (e.g., resolving with the conduct officer at the first meeting, requesting to schedule another meeting, or referral to a University Conduct Board hearing).</li>
<li>The student’s right to decline the resolution by agreement proposed by the conduct officer and proceed to a formal hearing.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>7.5</strong><span> </span>A Resolution by Agreement meeting may result in one of the following outcomes:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>A student(s)/organization(s) and conduct officer mutually agree on an outcome, including agreement on any policy violations and sanctions.</li>
<li>A resolution between the student and the conduct officer is not reached and the student is referred to a University Conduct Board or Administrative Hearing Officer.</li>
<li>The alleged misconduct, if true, would not constitute a violation of the Student Conduct Code.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>7.6<span> </span></strong>If a student/student organization does not attend the scheduled resolution meeting without prior notice to Community Standards, or elects not to participate in the Resolution by Agreement process, a decision may be rendered in the student’s or organization’s absence.</p>
<p><strong>7.7<span> </span></strong>A student(s)/organization(s) may request that a resolution by agreement be reconsidered within five (5) business days. After five (5) days the resolution by agreement is considered final. Requests for reconsideration submitted within five (5) days shall be reviewed by the Director of Community Standards (or designee).

<p><strong>8.1<span> </span></strong>Student conduct cases that are not resolved through a resolution by agreement will proceed to a formal hearing before the University Conduct Board or an Administrative Hearing Officer. The University Conduct Board or Administrative Hearing Officer is responsible for considering all relevant information, determining facts, responsibility, and sanctions, if appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>8.2<span> </span></strong>The Respondent(s) will be given written notice of the charges stating: the incident report(s) and any associated evidence; the alleged Student Conduct Code violations; the procedures to be used in resolving the charges; and the date, time, and location of the hearing. Notice will be emailed at least five (5) business days prior to the hearing to the Respondent(s) syr.edu email address. The Respondent(s) will be granted access to the case file for review.</p>
<p><strong>8.3</strong><span> </span>The order of the formal hearing is typically as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>introductions and reading of the complaint/appeal by the hearing chair,</li>
<li>reading of the alleged charges against the Respondent, and the Respondent&#8217;s response to these charges;</li>

<li>presentation of information/witnesses by the Case Presenter, questioning of participating parties/witnesses through the Hearing Chair/Administrative Hearing Officer;</li>
<li>presentation of information/witnesses by the Respondent, questioning of the Respondent through the Hearing Chair/Administrative Hearing Officer.</li>
<li>closing statement by the Complainant and/or Case Presenter;</li>
<li>closing statement by the Respondent.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>8.4</b>The Respondent(s) and Case Presenter may object to the participation of a Board member due to conflict of interest. Any objection will be decided by the Hearing Chair, or by vote of the majority of the Board if the objection is to the Hearing Chair’s participation. If there is an objection to an Administrative Hearing Officer, the objection should be communicated to the Director of Community Standards.</p>
<p><b>8.5</b>At the conclusion of the hearing, all parties, including the Case Presenter, are dismissed, and the University Conduct Board/Administrative Hearing Officer begins deliberations regarding responsibility, and if appropriate, sanction(s).</p>
<p><strong>8.6<span> </span></strong>The University Conduct Board is a three (3) member panel comprised of students, faculty, and/or staff members, or external professionals as determined by Community Standards. The University Conduct Board members receive training each year and are advised by a trained designee of the Director of Community Standards, who may be internal or external to the University.</p>
<p>Administrative Hearing Officers, who may be faculty or staff members or external professionals, are appointed by the Director of Community Standards and receive training on the University Conduct System.</p>
<p><strong>8.7<span> </span></strong>An audio recording will be made for all formal resolution hearings. Recordings will not include deliberations. The Respondent(s) may request that a written transcript of these recordings be made at the expense of the Respondent(s) (except in cases of disability accommodation) or have access to the recordings by arrangement with the Director of Community Standards. Printed transcripts will be redacted as required by Federal and Student privacy laws prior to being released. Additional recording devices (audio and/or video) of any kind are not permitted for use during formal resolution hearings. Students may take notes during the proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>8.8<span> </span></strong>If a Respondent(s) or Case Presenter would like to call witnesses regarding the facts of the case, names of potential witnesses and a summary of the facts to which they will testify, must be submitted to Community Standards by the date outlined in the formal hearing notice. Case Presenters and Respondents are limited to five (5) witnesses each for a hearing. If a Respondent(s) or Case Presenter believes they need the testimony of more than five (5) witnesses, these additional witnesses may submit a written statement. Witness lists will be made available to the Respondent(s) and Case Presenter. Character witnesses are not permitted.</p>
<p>The Hearing Chair/Administrative Hearing Officer will have the discretion to allow or exclude witnesses proposed by either party when the information offered by a witness would be duplicative or irrelevant, or the witness would unnecessarily compromise the confidentiality of the hearing. No witness may be compelled to attend any formal resolution hearing.</p>
<p><strong>8.9<span> </span></strong>All parties are encouraged to appear at a formal hearing. If a party fails to appear, the hearing may proceed or be rescheduled at the discretion of the University Conduct Board/Hearing Chair/Administrative Hearing Officer. In cases where either party is unable to appear, alternative means for participation may be made available at the discretion of the Director of Community Standards or designee.</p>
<p><strong>8.10<span> </span></strong>All parties are expected to be respectful of the proceedings and the rights of all individuals involved. It is the responsibility of each party to ensure advisors, witnesses, and other affiliates act in a respectful manner. The Hearing Chair/Administrative Hearing Officer may discontinue the hearing and forward the case for administrative resolution by the Director of Community Standards, or designee, when the behavior of any participant might be detrimental to the outcome of the hearing.</p>
<p>Attendance at hearings is limited to the University Conduct Board/Administrative Hearing Officer and their advisor, the Case Presenter, and the parties immediately involved and their Procedural Advisors. Witnesses are permitted in the hearing solely for their own testimony. Witnesses should not discuss their testimony with any other witnesses who have not yet testified.</p>
<p>Only the University Conduct Board /Administrative Hearing Officer and their advisors are permitted in deliberations.</p>
<p><strong>8.11<span> </span></strong>At the hearing, parties are expected to provide all relevant information including statements, witnesses, and tangible/physical evidence. Failure to provide relevant information available at the time of the hearing may not later be used as a ground for appeal as outlined in Part 10.</p>
<p><strong>8.12</strong><span> </span>Relevance of information will be determined at the Hearing. The University Conduct Board/Administrative Hearing Officer may ask relevant questions at any time.</p>
<p><strong>8.13<span> </span></strong>All participating parties and the Case Presenter will have the opportunity to ask relevant questions indirectly of the other participating parties and witness(s) through the Hearing Chair/Administrative Hearing Officer if it is deemed relevant to the matters at issue.</p>
<p><strong>8.14</strong><span> </span>As this is an administrative University process, formal rules of evidence found in legal proceedings do not apply. Any information or statement maybe admitted (including hearsay) at the discretion of the Hearing Chair/Administrative Hearing Officer.</p>
<p><strong>8.15<span> </span></strong>After the closing statements, the University Conduct Board/ Administrative Hearing Officer will deliberate on and determine the finding of responsibility for each alleged violation. University Conduct Board decisions on responsibility are made by a majority vote of the Board members using a Preponderance of the Evidence, or “more likely than not” standard.</p>
<p><strong>8.16</strong><span> </span>If a student or organization is found responsible for any violations, the University Conduct Board/Administrative Hearing Officer will consider appropriate sanctions (see Part 9).</p>
<p><strong>8.17<span> </span></strong>Decisions of the University Conduct Board/Administrative Hearing Officer are reviewed and confirmed by the Director of Community Standards, or designee. The Director can, as appropriate, interview any participant in an earlier proceeding, modify the decision, alter the sanction, or return the case to the Board for further process. Following the review and confirmation of the decision, the Respondent will receive written notice of the confirmed decision no later than eight (8) business days after the hearing has concluded. Decisions and sanctions may become effective immediately, except while an appeal is pending, unless otherwise stated by the Director of Community Standards or designee. The timing of any sanctions will be specified in the written notice of the decision.</p>
<p><strong>8.18</strong><span> </span>Complainants and Respondents may appeal formal resolution hearing decisions using the procedures outlined in Part 10.</p>

        <p>The primary goal of the University Student Conduct System is education. In addition to educational sanctions, the University may issue sanctions that affect a student or student organization’s status at the University. All sanctions are official actions of the University. Failure to comply with sanctions or with specific conditions related to the safety and security of any persons or property while a case is pending may result in further conduct charges.</p>
<p><strong>9.1<span> </span></strong>Sanctions are assigned based on the context and nature of the violations and the status of the Respondent. Specifically, Conduct Officers (Resolution by Agreement) and University Conduct Boards Administrative Hearing Officers (formal hearings) will consider the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>the extent of harm caused or impact on individuals and the community (living environment, University community, and the surrounding community) including the level of intervention necessary;</li>
<li>the potential for ongoing risk to the student, other individuals, the community, or property, or the potential for ongoing disruption of University operations;</li>
<li>a student’s disciplinary record and history of past conduct sanctions, including but not limited to, sanctions in prior similar University conduct cases involving similar or analogous misconduct;</li>
<li>student’s intent, remorse, cooperation, and willingness to take responsibility for their actions;</li>
<li>evidence that the student’s conduct was motivated by bias regarding an individual or group’s real or perceived race, color, creed, religion, political or social affiliation, sex, gender, reproductive health decisions, national origin, citizenship, ethnicity, marital status, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, and/or veteran status; and</li>
<li>whether the student or student organization engaged in help-seeking behavior.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>9.2</strong><span> </span>The following sanctions, or any combination thereof, may be applied to any individual student or student organization, for violations of the Student Conduct Code and related University policies:</p>
<ul></ul>
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Educational</strong>: The primary goal of the University Student Conduct System is education. Respective Boards, Administrative Hearing Officers, and Conduct Officers may design sanctions that are specific to an individual case when it is determined that educational value may result, and the interests of the University community are maintained. Examples of educational sanctions include, but are not limited to, community service, community involvement assignments, decision making assignments, civility workshops, monetary restitution, and research and writing assignments.</li>
<li><strong></strong><strong>Access Restriction:<span> </span></strong>Restriction to certain areas/campus facilities and/or events as appropriate, which may include, but not limited to: residential areas, recreational spaces, dining facilities, athletic spaces, or others as deemed necessary based on the Respondent’s conduct.</li>
<li><strong>Residential Warning</strong>: This status is a formal warning on behalf of the residential living program and is intended to clearly document in a student’s disciplinary file that the student’s behavior is unacceptable. The length of this status will be determined by the Conduct Officer or hearing body/official.</li>
<li><strong>Residential Probation</strong>: This status indicates a student is no longer in good standing within the University’s residential living program. Further violations may result in the immediate loss of eligibility to live in or visit the University’s residence and/or dining facilities.</li>
<li><strong>Residential Relocation/Suspension/Expulsion</strong>: These statuses indicate a student is not eligible to live in or visit some or all the University’s residential and/or dining facilities. A residential relocation involves the reassignment of a student’s living unit within University housing and usually prohibits the student from returning to the residential area associated with the former living assignment. A residential suspension or expulsion involves the student’s removal from University housing altogether. These statuses may extend for a specific period, until the completion of specific conditions, or permanently. These statuses may be limited to a specific facility or applied to all facilities.</li>
<li><strong>Social Probation</strong>: This status is applied for a breach of specific expectations by a student organization. Its primary effect is to suspend a privilege related to the nature of the offense and/or restrict access to specific campus facilities or programs.</li>
<li><strong>Conduct Warning</strong>: This status is a formal warning on behalf of the University and is intended to clearly document in a student’s or student organization’s disciplinary file that their behavior is unacceptable. The length of this status will be determined by the Conduct Officer, or University Conduct Board/Administrative Hearing Officer.</li>
<li><strong>Conduct Probation</strong>: This action indicates that a student or student organization is at risk of losing matriculation or affiliation with the University unless certain standards are adhered to. The student or student organization is permitted to remain enrolled or retain recognition by the University under stated conditions based on the nature of the violation and the potential learning that may derive from specific restrictive measures. Students on conduct probation may not hold or run for elected or appointed leadership positions including, but not limited to, resident assistants, peer leaders or mentors, orientation leaders, Student Association leaders and leadership positions in recognized clubs and organizations, including professional and social fraternities and sororities. Student organizations, recognized clubs, and fraternities and sororities on conduct probation and found responsible for subsequent violations of the Code may be suspended or lose their recognition. Further violations may result in immediate suspension or expulsion from the University. The length of this status will be determined by the Conduct Officer or hearing body/official.</li>
<li><strong>Suspension</strong>: This action results in a student’s immediate involuntary withdrawal from the University, or for a student organization, the loss of University recognition and related privileges, for a stated period of time as determined by the University Conduct Board/Administrative Hearing Officer. A suspended student or student organization is prohibited from any presence or activity on University-owned, operated, or controlled property, including but not limited, to University-owned property leased to a non-University affiliated party, and from participation in any class or program offered by Syracuse University. If a student is issued a sanction of suspension after completing all degree requirements, but prior to degree conferral, their degree will not be conferred until the period of suspension is completed.</li>
<li><strong>Expulsion:<span> </span></strong>This action results in the permanent separation of the student or student organization from the University, its programs and facilities. It is the most severe disciplinary action the University Student Conduct System can impose. Students expelled prior to degree conferral will not have their degree conferred. An expelled student or student organization is prohibited from any presence or activity on University-owned, operated, or controlled property, including but not limited, to University-owned property leased to a non-University affiliated party, and from participation in any class, program, or event, offered by Syracuse University.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>9.3</strong><span> </span>Sanctioning Guidelines</p>
<p>Sanctioning guidelines have been adopted to respond to violations of the Student Conduct Code. Syracuse University is deeply concerned about the extent to which some students engage in underage consumption of alcohol, unlawful use of drugs, and/or consumption of alcohol or other drugs to a degree that renders them in need of emergency medical intervention or other extraordinary assistance. In addition, Syracuse University seeks to deter students from engaging in conduct that poses a risk to the safety and well-being of the individual student and/or the University community. Sanctioning guidelines are intended to alert students and other members of the University community to the seriousness of alcohol- and drug-related behaviors, violence, and safety violations; provide meaningful consequences for violations of University expectations and community standards; and ensure that students are provided opportunities to access education, counseling, and support.</p>
<p>In all cases the appropriate sanction(s) will be determined on a case-by-case basis considering all the relevant circumstances. The presence of substantial mitigating, aggravating, or other appropriate circumstances may result in the reduction or augmentation of sanctioning guidelines.</p>

<p><strong>10.1<span> </span></strong>Decisions of the University Conduct Board or Administrative Hearing Officer are effective immediately, unless a written notice of intention to appeal has been received by Community Standards within two (2) business days after the decision is made available.</p>
<p><strong>10.2</strong><span> </span>Appeals must be based on one or more of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>New information is provided that was not reasonably available at the time of the original hearing.</li>
<li>Procedural error that can be shown to have had a detrimental impact on the outcome of the hearing.</li>
<li>Grossly inappropriate sanction having no reasonable relationship to the charges.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>10.3<span> </span></strong>The Respondent may appeal the decision of the University Conduct Board or Administrative Hearing Officer in writing within five (5) business days after the written decision is made available. Extensions for appeals may be requested of the Director of Community Standards in the event there are extenuating circumstances. All appeals must be authored and submitted by the Respondent. Appeal submissions must not be more than two (2) pages per ground for appeal.</p>
<p>Appeals submitted to Community Standards will be reviewed by the Associate Vice President and Dean of Students, or designee, to determine if the party’s narrative supports the selected ground(s) for appeal listed in Part 10.2. If the appeal is timely and contains sufficient information, it will be forwarded to the University Appeals Board within five (5) business days. If the appeal is late or does not contain sufficient information, it will be dismissed and will not be reviewed by the University Appeals Board.  A student will be promptly notified of the dismissal of an appeal.</p>
<p><strong>10.4<span> </span></strong>The University Appeals Board is comprised of three (3) members who may be students, faculty, staff, or external professionals, as determined by Community Standards. The University Appeals Board has authority to hear appeals of decisions from any non-academic Conduct Board, as well as any Administrative Hearing Officer described in these procedures. The University Appeals Board is advised by the Director of Community Standards if the director has not been involved in the original hearing, or by a designee.</p>
<p><strong>10.5<span> </span></strong>The University Appeals Board may affirm the decision, modify the decision, reduce the sanction, or return the case to a University Conduct Board/Administrative Hearing Officer for further process. If the University Appeals Board believes the sanction imposed is insufficient in light of the misconduct at issue in the case, it shall return the case to the University Conduct Board/Administrative Hearing Officer for reconsideration of sanction(s).</p>
<p><strong>10.6<span> </span></strong>The University Appeals Board will make a decision based on the written submissions within five (5) business days of the University Appeals Board meeting to review the appeal.</p>
<p><strong>10.7<span> </span></strong>Decisions of the University Appeals Board will be final when reviewed and confirmed by the Senior Vice President and Chief Student Experience Officer (SVP), or designee. The SVP, or designee, may interview any participant in an earlier proceeding, modify the decision, alter the sanctions imposed, or return the case to the University Appeals Board or another hearing Board for further process. Decisions of the SVP, or designee, are final and no further University review is permitted. Review and confirmation by the SVP, or designee, will be made within five (5) business days after the decision of the University Appeals Board is communicated.</p>

        <p><strong>13.1<span> </span></strong>A student’s request to access and inspect their disciplinary records maintained by Syracuse University is handled in accordance with the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.</p>
<p>Syracuse University will notify parents or guardians of conduct issues involving minor (non-adult) students.</p>

        <p><strong>14.1</strong><span> </span>The University reserves the right to place a hold on a Respondent student’s academic records until an investigation and subsequent conduct case (if any) is resolved. The hold may prevent the student from registering for classes, obtaining a copy of their academic transcript, or conferral of their degree.</p>
<p>A student who attempts to withdraw from the University rather than participate in the conduct process may be classified as having been withdrawn for disciplinary reasons. This status will be noted on the student’s transcript as “Withdrew with Conduct Charges Pending.” A student who withdraws under these circumstances is not permitted to enter onto Syracuse University-owned, operated, or controlled property, including but not limited to, University-owned land leased to a non-University affiliated party, and may not participate in any course or program offered by Syracuse University until the pending matter is resolved.</p>

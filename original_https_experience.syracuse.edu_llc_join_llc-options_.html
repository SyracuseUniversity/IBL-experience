<p>We offer more than 30 Living Learning Communities (LLCs). An LLC is a group of students who share a common major or academic affiliation, live together in a residence hall, have intentional faculty support and engage in academic and social experiences on and off campus.</p>



<p>LLCs can range in size, with some as small as 10 students and others with over 200 students! Additionally, LLCs are arranged in the residence halls in a variety of ways. Based on their size, some LLCs fill an entire floor, or even multiple floors, while others may exist as a cluster of rooms on part of a floor. With all these options, it’s important to know your LLC floor could be all LLC students or a mixture of LLC and non-LLC students.</p>



<p>For more information about each individual LLC, please read the descriptions below.&nbsp; For more general information about the LLC program, please visit our <a href="https://experience.syracuse.edu/llc/about-us/faqs/">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is a good idea to join an LLC to help you meet more people in that are interested in the same subject areas as you. Participating in an LLC has helped me meet people which in turn makes more people familiar on campus and I can build more connections. The LLC helps take the pressure off of reaching out to and meeting people because you&#8217;re all a part of the LLC and have events to go to.&#8221; &#8211; Jett McKenney</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Being in the Upperclass MLLC has made me feel more comfortable with the other residents of my dorm and has helped me build stronger friendships with other students. It has helped me get insight on different courses from other students and broaden my knowledge of the different course offerings at Syracuse University. I would highly recommend a student join an LLC as a way to find community more effectively.&#8221; &#8211; Jamily Rivas Nunez</p></blockquote>
